# AePhotos
Aephotos is a decentralized way for people  to store images on the internet, similar to google photos but aephotos stores its images in a decentralized way.
Many a time the same images are stored multiple times on the same server or multiple servers and this leads to an excessive use of storage on this servers, but with Aephotos an image is only stored once due to how the interplanetary file system works so  the same image is never stored twice, rather it is  a reference to those images using their IPFS hash that can be stored twice
